This is Lithium's Group 9 Project.

The final project output is a sign-up page for a campaign that advocates on current issues that are being faced. The sign-up page when filled out and submitted will then send the user to their very own profile page that presents the information that the user inputted.

For this project, group 9's advocation is all about catering to the educational needs of differently abled individuals. The campaign is called the "Lotus Sanctuary" whose tagline is "Sanctuary of knowledge for all people of all kinds."

*It is advised to run the program on F11 or full screen mode.

The step-by-step process on how this web page works is as follows:

	1. Firstly, the user has to click on the page's link to access the sign-up page.
	2. Afterwards, once the sign-up page loads in, the user is asked to input certain data.
	3. Once the user inputs the data and clicks submit, the user is redirected to the profile page. (If the user does not fill out all the required information and clicks submit, the borders of the required information turns red and the word "Required" will appear beside the blank).
	4. Once the user is redirected to the profile page, their inputted data is outputted onto a personalized portion of the screen titled "Member Information". Here, the user's name (first & last), sex, email, and reasons for supporting the campaign can be seen.
	5. In the header, there are 2 clickable links that can transport the user back to the sign-up page or be transported to the campaign's about us page.
